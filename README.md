# PersonalProject
This is a personal project which I decided to use for my final college project. The project is a web app developed using Python, HTML, JQuery Mobile & PayPal sdk. It is a test web application for the concept of allowing businesses in the bar industry to sell their products to their customers through the web app.

The most up to date code is in the Pythonanywhere directory which contains the main code for the web app including html files.
